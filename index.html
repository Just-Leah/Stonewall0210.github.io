            You can see some of the stuff I made that I'm proud enough of to show here down below.

        <h2>UnderFabric</h2>
        <p>
            A Minecraft mod that adds tons of Undertale related stuff to the game.
        </p>
        <h2>Resource Backport</h2>
        <p>
            A Minecraft resource pack that takes new textures from snapshots and ports them to the latest stable version.
        </p>
        <h2>Chat Logger</h2>
        <p>
            A python script that takes the chat out of Minecraft logs and puts it in a new file.
